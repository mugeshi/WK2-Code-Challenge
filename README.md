Flataculties - Cutest Animal Voting App
Welcome to Flataculties, an exciting web application where users can vote for the cutest animals! This app is designed to help you practice your skills in array iteration, DOM manipulation, event handling, and server communication. By completing this challenge, you will gain hands-on experience in building a frontend application that interacts with a local API.

Learning Goals
In this challenge, you will have the opportunity to achieve the following learning goals:

Gain familiarity with fetching data from a local server running a JSON DB.
Practice manipulating the DOM to display and update information dynamically.
Implement event handling to respond to user interactions.
Improve your skills in array iteration to work with dynamic data.
Enhance your understanding of client-server communication.
Instructions
Please follow the instructions below to successfully complete the Flataculties challenge:

Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data:

Create a new project folder on your computer.
Create a new private GitHub repository specifically for this project.
Add your TM (Teaching Assistant or Instructor) as a contributor to the repository (for grading purposes).
Ensure that you regularly commit your work to the repository.
In your project directory, create a file named db.json. This file will serve as your server's database.
Use the provided data from the data file and populate the db.json file with the appropriate information.
Project Guidelines:

Your project should adhere to the following guidelines throughout the development process.
Core Deliverables:

Users should be able to see a list of all animal names by making a GET request to the /characters endpoint.
Clicking on an animal's name should display its details, including the animal's image and current number of votes. Retrieve this information by making a GET request to the /characters/:id endpoint.
When viewing an animal's details, users should be able to add votes for that animal. The updated vote count should be displayed alongside the animal's details. Note that the votes do not need to persist upon page refresh.
Bonus Deliverables (optional):

Implement a reset button that resets the votes for all animals back to 0.
Include a form for adding new animals to the list. Users should be able to provide the animal's name and image URL and submit the details for it to appear in the list of animals.
Development Process:

Start by planning your application, including the user interface, layout, and interactions.
Once your plan is in place, proceed with implementing the frontend functionality.
Make use of array iteration, DOM manipulation, event handling, and server communication techniques to achieve the required deliverables.
Commit your work regularly to track your progress and ensure code safety.
Remember to refer back to this README file throughout the development process to ensure that you are meeting the project requirements and guidelines.
